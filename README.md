## A Simple Todo List

https://a4-stephenfanning.onrender.com

This application is a very simple to-do list that lets you keep track of tasks. Simply type the details of the task and click "Submit". You can enter the same task (but with different course, due date, or add date values) to modify existing entries in the list, and you can press "Clear" to delete them all. The Todo list is also user-specific. (No functional changes from Assignment A3)

The new technology hindered the development process, but only because of my inexperience with it. Troubleshooting various issues, both with the client and integration with the server, proved exceptionally difficult given my limited experience with React and websites in general. However, I can clearly see how using React would greatly improve the development experience provided that the developer is experienced with the software.
